simpleseed is a fully functional tenet written in under 40 lines of code. 

The tenet itself asserts that "every comment should be awesome", with a rather
arbitary definition of "awesome". It serves as an example of how simple it is
to write a tenet. You can run the tenet with:

`$ lingo lingoreviews/simpleseed`.
